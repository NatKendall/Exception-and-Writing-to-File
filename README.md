# Exception-and-Writing-to-File
The program shows my knowledge of exception handling as well as writing to a file. 

The instructions were to create a project that sorts an array and then calculates the average, standard deviation and places the array in ascending order.
Once those methods were created, I then had to write to a file named Gradesout.txt to show the average and standard deviation
I also had to print all the above 
I learned how to use exception handling by throwing an exception and catching errors to then be solved.
